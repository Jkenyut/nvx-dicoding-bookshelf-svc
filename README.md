# Bookshelf API Project

## Description

This project is a simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Hapi. This API allows users to manage a digital collection of books. Users can add, view, update, and delete book data.

This project is an implementation of the submission for the "Learning to Build Back-End Applications for Beginners" class from Dicoding.

## Key Features

- **Add a New Book**: Saves a new book to the shelf.
- **Get All Books**: Retrieves a list of all stored books.
    - Includes filtering options by `name`, `reading` status, and `finished` status.
- **Get Book Details**: Fetches complete information for a single book using its unique ID.
- **Update Book Data**: Updates an existing book's data based on its ID.
- **Delete a Book**: Removes a book from the shelf based on its ID.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for the server side.
- **Hapi**: A framework for building web applications and services.
- **nanoid**: A library for generating compact and secure unique IDs.
